# DataStructures-Algorithms-Using-C

This repository contains C programs that I have written and practiced during my studies of different subjects i.e Problem Solving & Programmic through C, Data Structures and Design & Analysis of Algorithms. The programs cover a variety of concepts and topics related to C programming. This serves as a personal archive to track my learning progress and improve my coding skills.

## Repository Structure

- **Programs**: All C programs related to different concepts and exercises which included in the following subjects.
    ##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Problem Solving & Programmic through C (PSPC)
    ##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Data Structures (DS)
    ##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Design & Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)
- **Notes**: (Optional) Any additional notes or resources I used while solving the exercises.

## Getting Started

To get started with the programs in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
